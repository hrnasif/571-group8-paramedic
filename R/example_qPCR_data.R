#' Example abolute abundance data
#'
#' A dataset inspired by data collected by the University of Washington (UW) 
#' Sexually Transmitted Infections Cooperative Research Center (STICRC). Absolute abundance, 
#' as measured by taxon-specific absolute primers,
#' is available on 20 samples but only 7 taxa, and is provided in `example_qPCR_data`.
#' 
#' @format `example_qPCR_data`: a tibble with 20 rows and 8 columns. The first column is subject identifiers,
#' and each subsequent column is the absolute abundance
#' of a particular taxon in a given sample (row).
#' @source Inspired by data collected for Project 2 of the UW STICRC \url{http://depts.washington.edu/cfas/research/sexually-transmitted-infections-cooperative-research-center/projects/establishing-microbial-and-biochemical-thresholds-for-development-and-persistence-of-bacterial-vaginosis/}.
